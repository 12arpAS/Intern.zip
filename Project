Task 1 - Data Pipeline Development

Description: Created an ETL pipeline using Pandas and Scikit-learn. The pipeline is for data preprocessing, transformation, and loading.




Deliverable: A Python script or notebook automating the ETL process.

Task 2 - Deep Learning Project

Description: Implemented a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow Keras. The model was built, trained, and evaluated on the MNIST dataset.



Deliverable: A functional model with visualizations of results.

Task 3 - End-to-End Data Science Project

Description: Developed a full data science project from data collection and preprocessing to model deployment using Flask or FastAPI.


Deliverable: A deployed API or web app showcasing the model's functionality.

Task 4 - Optimization Model

Description: Solved a business problem using optimization techniques like linear programming and Python libraries such as PuLP. The project involved formulating constraints and an objective to maximize profit under resource limitations.


Deliverable: A notebook demonstrating the problem setup, solution, and insights.
